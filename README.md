# security-marketing-emails

This repo contains a script to fetch emails from the spam folder of my work email, which is used to update a data dump of security marketing emails I receive.

## Usage

Create a google app password for your email:
https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en

Then run `EMAIL=<email> PASSWORD=<app password> index.rb`
